### Website Structure and Navigation Overview (R5)

![1](./docs/wireframes/Portfolio%20Sitemap.png)

I have decided to go with a simple website structure based on the sitemap above. The Home page consists of two different sections: an About section and a Project section. From the home page, we can navigate to each of those sections as well as to the Blogs page. The Blogs page displays all the blogs in a section, from which we can navigate to each of the individual blogs.

I used Uizard to create wireframes for the websites. I found Uizard much more beginner-friendly compared to something like Figma. It was not difficult to create wireframes for screens of different sizes. I was able to create different sections of the page, which made it easier to visualise what my website would look like in different screen sizes. For the home page, I decided to follow a simple layout. I chose to display the about section and projects section on the home page since I felt like those two are related topics. I also decided to have a separate page for my blogs, and the design was inspired by the website Medium - an online publishing platform. This website follows a similar theme to what I had planned, which I felt would work well together with mine.

When it came to the overall aesthetic of my portfolio, I conducted extensive research on various portfolio layouts and colour schemes. I discovered that the choice of colours is crucial for creating a cohesive theme that ties all the components together. This contributes to the overall layout and helps users to easily distinguish between different sections of the page. After testing different colour schemes, I opted for a blue colour palette as the theme for my website. The colours work well with each section, creating a simple yet effective theme, in my opinion.
