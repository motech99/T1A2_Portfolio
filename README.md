### Website Structure and Navigation Overview (R5)

![1](./docs/wireframes/Portfolio%20Sitemap.png)

I have decided to go with a simple website structure based on the sitemap above. The Home page consists of two different sections: an About section and a Project section. From the home page, we can navigate to each of those sections as well as to the Blogs page. The Blogs page displays all the blogs in a section, from which we can navigate to each of the individual blogs.

I used Uizard to create wireframes for the websites. I found Uizard much more beginner-friendly compared to something like Figma. It was not difficult to create wireframes for screens of different sizes. I was able to create different sections of the page, which made it easier to visualise what my website would look like in different screen sizes. For the home page, I decided to follow a simple layout. I chose to display the about section and projects section on the home page since I felt like those two are related topics. I also decided to have a separate page for my blogs, and the design was inspired by the website Medium - an online publishing platform. This website follows a similar theme to what I had planned, which I felt would work well together with mine.

When it came to the overall aesthetic of my portfolio, I conducted extensive research on various portfolio layouts and colour schemes. I discovered that the choice of colours is crucial for creating a cohesive theme that ties all the components together. This contributes to the overall layout and helps users to easily distinguish between different sections of the page. After testing different colour schemes, I opted for a blue colour palette as the theme for my website. The colours work well with each section, creating a simple yet effective theme, in my opinion.

## Target Audience and Website Components

### Components list

### Main Page

- **Navigation Bar:** Responsive designed navigation bar with each heading linked to the relevant section of the page, providing better accessibility on every page. This applies to every page of the website.

- **Main Section:** This is the main screen of the website. It features an image with a heading, a button to download my CV, and social media icons for GitHub and LinkedIn, which lead to those profiles. This setup allows potential employers to access my CV and also enables other developers to connect with me on LinkedIn or GitHub. I chose to place these elements on my main page to ensure they are the first features visitors see when they land on my website. This should make it easier to build connections and easier to network.

- **About Section:** Features an image with a section of a paragraph about myself showing my interests, hobbies, and why I started coding. This section allows the readers to get to know me a little better and the reason why I started coding!

- **Project Section:** This section of my website showcases all of my previous projects that I have worked on. It allows users to see the type of projects I've previously worked on. It features an image of the project, a brief description, and a link to the GitHub repository for that project.

- **footer:** This section of the page contains my full name, copyright information, and social media icons linked to my profiles.
