### Website Structure and Navigation Overview (R5)

![1](./docs/wireframes/Portfolio%20Sitemap.png)

I have decided to go with a simple website structure based on the sitemap above. The Home page consists of two different sections: an About section and a Project section. From the home page, we can navigate to each of those sections as well as to the Blogs page. The Blogs page displays all the blogs in a section, from which we can navigate to each of the individual blogs.

The wireframes I have created were designed on Uizard. I found the online tool to be much more beginner-friendly compared to something like Figma. I didn't find it too difficult to create different wireframes for screens of different sizes. I was able to create different sections of the site with ease, Which made it easier to adjust any changes. This helped with testing different colour schemes, creating different screen sizes for responsiveness and being able to see the complete version of the site on all screens. When it came to the layout of my Home page, I was inspired by a variety of portfolios online. Most of these portfolios follow a one-dimensional layout which is what I wanted. The home page is separated by two other sections. The About and Project section. I decided to place those sections on the same page as I felt like they were related. For the rest of the website, I separated the Blogs into a different page which then can lead to the individual blogs. Finally, I was inspired by the website Medium - an online publishing platform. This website follows a similar layout to what I had planned, which I felt would work well with my Blog page.

When it came to the overall look of my portfolio, I decided to look at various portfolio layouts and colour schemes. I discovered that the choice of colours is important for creating a cohesive theme that ties all the components together. This contributes to the overall layout and helps users to easily distinguish between different sections of the page. After testing different colour schemes, I decided to go with a blue colour palette as the theme for my website. The colours work well with each section, creating a simple yet effective theme, in my opinion.

## Target Audience and Website Components (R7)

### Components list

### Main Page

- **Navigation Bar :** Responsive designed navigation bar with each heading linked to the relevant section of the page, providing better accessibility on every page. This applies to every page of the website.

- **Main Section:** This is the main screen of the website. It features an image with a heading, a button to download my CV, and social media icons for GitHub and LinkedIn, which lead to those profiles. This setup allows potential employers to access my CV and also enables other developers to connect with me on LinkedIn or GitHub. I chose to place these elements on my main page to ensure they are the first features visitors see when they land on my website. This should make it easier to build connections and easier to network.

- **About Section:** Features an image with a section of a paragraph about myself showing my interests, hobbies, and why I started coding. This section allows the readers to get to know me a little better and the reason why I started coding!

- **Project Section:** This section of my website showcases all of my previous projects that I have worked on. It allows users to see the type of projects I've previously worked on. It features an image of the project, a brief description, and a link to the GitHub repository for that project.

- **footer:** The footer component is dedicated to showcasing copyright details that indicate ownership, as well as social media icons that link to my profiles. Consistency in design is important, in order to maintaining the professional look of the website, its important to have a footer on every page to keep the layout consistent.

### Blogs Page

- **Navigation Bar:** Same as Home page.

- **Main Section:** This section of the website is linked to a separate page, Blogs Page. This is so the users can mainly focus on each of the Blogs by not having other content there. Each blog contains an image, title and the date published. each blog is separated from each others for better readability for the users.

- **Footer:** Same as Home Page.

### Individual Blog Page

- **Navigation Bar:** In this component, I have decided to remove some of the navigation links to only display the Home and the Blogs links. This improves readability for the users and makes it easier to navigate between those pages.

- **Main Section:** This component is made up of the Title of the Blog, the author's image and the published date. This is then separated by the image and finally, the article will be displayed at the bottom of that section. All articles are centred in the middle of the page in all screen sizes. This technique is used by other blogs/article sites that I came across. I believe It helps with the readability of the website as it's in the center of the page.

- **Footer:** same as Home Page.
